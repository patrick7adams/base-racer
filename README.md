Comes from the puzzle game Turing Complete on steam. In Turing Complete, there are two levels that test the player on their understanding of binary
and hexadecimal by forcing them to convert int/hex to binary in a decreasing timeframe by clicking tickers rather than typing it in. This is a pygame
replication of these levels.
